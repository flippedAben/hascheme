# Haskell Scheme Interpreter

For setting up the build, I followed a [guide by Stephen Diehl][1].
Specifically, I looked at the Cabal and Testing sections.

Then, I used another guide called "[Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours][2]", which
is the meat of this project.

In addition, I also referenced an [extended guide][3] made by Adam Wespiser. He wrote
version two with interesting additions.
